My Story: The finish in Spring

When I was growing up, I always had a never give up mentality which helped me thrive and succeed in different areas of my life in which I was going through difficult times, but I put my head down and worked so hard never letting anything or anybody get in my way. My goal was to be as big as bill gates as big as big as elon musk as big as the as worlds richest man , i had aspirations and dreams bigger than myself. I had finished my leaving cert with high grades in all my subjects and got into one of the best ranked universities in the country, I worked hard in college for the four years of my course and trying to achieve my goal, i was determined even though many obstacles were in my, I then got my degree with first class and worked my way up in different businesses until i had ability to start up my own business which was different in its approach and that all led to my success story to this day. The moral of the story is too never give up on anything and know that everybody in life no matter their consequences or situations will find a way and have their chance at success and reach their main goal in life.
