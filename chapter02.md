My Story: Chapter 2 - Learning

There is a secret behind every success story. This story is different as it begins, I was young and naive, always dreaming of the biggest dreams, wanting to be something so great, One thing i learned from young is to never listen to anyone who puts your dream and aspirations down because if you have the drive and determination to keep going even though there are obstacles in your way you will definately make it big, this is what i told myself everyday when growing up.
