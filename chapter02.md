My Story: Chapter 2 - Learning in Spring

There is a secret behind every success story. This story is different as it begins, I was young and naive, always dreaming of the biggest dreams, wanting to be something so great, One thing i learned from young is to never listen to anyone who puts your dream and aspirations down because if you have the drive and determination to keep going even though there are obstacles in your way you will definately make it big, this is what i told myself everyday when growing up. In the world that we live in i believe that what is taught to someone when growing up, We use the kinds of ways and morals that we learned to protect our goals and beliefs, I think i was afraid sometimes growing up to question different things in life and experiences that i had that changed me in many ways. This life brought different trials and tribulations but i did my best to overcome them by working hard and putting my head down in whatever i want to do. I started football really young in primary in which the biggest aspirations to be like my football heroes that i had seen on television but all that was stopped later down the line in my life.
