My Story:The Process in the spring of April

I went  to school in Dublin, the school I went to was cbs lucan, this school had a bad reputation for its name even though it was an okay school before going to this school I was in lucan educate together primary school where people would tell me about the secondary I was going to wasn’t going to be a great experience for me but I knew that they were just trying to scare me from moving forward in life, I knew from primary that I had a goal to become a footballer when I grow up, I trained everyday and tried my best in the sport I loved at the time but the dream was all shattered and ruin when I got into secondary school  when I tried out for the football team and didn’t make the team ,so I moved on from football completely and went onto basketball in which I thrived in a bit and did my best I even won awards in the sport but that goal was also stooped due to me not being tall enough to go pro, all that loss didn’t stop me from being successful in life and I worked even harder in my studies from there and put sports aside.
